## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to help organizations better understand the nature of consumer complaints they receive, enabling them to improve their response strategies. The classification of complaints can assist in identifying trends and prioritizing areas for improvement.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Datasets library
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing consumer complaints, specifically focusing on the following columns:
- **Product**: The category of the product related to the complaint.
- **Consumer complaint narrative**: The textual description of the complaint.

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and class imbalances.

## Installation
To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

## Usage
1. Install the required packages
2. Load the dataset
3. Preprocess the data (cleaning, encoding, etc.) as described in the code.
4. Train the model using the provided code snippet.
5. Use the trained model to classify new complaints.

## Model Training
The model is trained using the following steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Encoding the labels
Tokenization of the text data
Training a BERT model using the Hugging Face Transformers library
The training process includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.

## Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: 0.78
F1 Score: 0.77

These results indicate that the model is effective in classifying consumer complaints into their respective categories.

## Future Work
Future enhancements for this project could include:

Fine-tuning the model for improved accuracy
Exploring different transformer architectures
Implementing data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset
Investigating model interpretability for better understanding of predictions
