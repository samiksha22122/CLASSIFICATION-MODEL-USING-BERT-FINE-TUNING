You do n't think you 'll ever make enough to pay that? That 's what your loan balance requires. We only offer temporary solutions. But afte r the 3-6 months the payment will be even higher. '' I offered a monthly payment of {$500.00} which is still more than I can comfortably afford, but the woman would not hear it.

Each time the amount they asked for included what was currently due, but also what was due for the next payment even if it was a month away. In early  XXXX , my mother used an open end loan and low interest rate credit card in her name to help me catch up.  Discover  received {$3400.00} in  XXXX   XXXX . I called to discuss the options for lowering the monthly payment and was told there were none.

You do n't think you 'll ever make enough to pay that? That 's what your loan balance requires. We only offer temporary solutions. But afte r the 3-6 months the payment will be even higher. '' I offered a monthly payment of {$500.00} which is still more than I can comfortably afford, but the woman would not hear it.
